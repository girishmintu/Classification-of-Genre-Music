Music Genre Classification with CRNN
This repository contains a project for classifying music genres using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). The model is built to recognize and classify audio samples into specific music genres with a high accuracy. The project is implemented in Python, using Google Colab for training and evaluation.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify music audio into various genres. This model uses a CRNN architecture that combines Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture both spatial and temporal features from audio data.

Key Features
CRNN Model: A hybrid architecture leveraging CNN layers for feature extraction and RNN layers for temporal sequence learning.
Data Preprocessing: Includes spectrogram generation, feature extraction using Librosa, and data augmentation for robust model training.
Performance Metrics: Achieves a high classification accuracy of 92% on the test set.
Visualization: Displays mel spectrograms and other audio features for performance evaluation and insights.
Dataset
The dataset consists of audio files from various music genres. Each sample has been preprocessed to extract mel spectrograms and other features necessary for the model to classify the genre accurately. (You can replace this with specific dataset details if applicable.)

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
Librosa
NumPy
Matplotlib

Model Architecture
The CRNN model combines convolutional layers to extract spatial features and recurrent layers to learn temporal sequences in audio data. The final layer uses softmax activation to output genre predictions.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 92% across multiple genres. Detailed performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss curves, are displayed in the notebook.

Future Improvements
Enhance genre classification by incorporating additional audio augmentation techniques.
Experiment with different CRNN architectures or hybrid models for improved accuracy.
Expand the dataset for better generalization across genres.
